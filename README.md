# SH Tracker

An app in development by Cheese and Bacon Games
http://cheeseandbacon.org/

SH Tracker is an app for tracking instances of self-harm. It is designed to be used to quickly input information when
an instance of self-harm occurs, giving the user an easy way to track their emotional well-being.


The app can be used to track instances of actual self-harm, but it also tracks instances of the user feeling the urge to self-harm but ultimately resisting that urge.
