Data view:
See event total for different time periods
A calendar view showing the last <time period> of events
Events derive a severity from urge severity and action severity (if present)
Calendar can have colors for each time period
Event severities should all be associated with a color spectrum
A time period can show either a base color or the color of the event in it
If a time period has multiple events in it, need to handle averaging the colors together
