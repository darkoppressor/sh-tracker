Should any more reason or action info be shown on add event screen?

Add ability to delete event from day screen?

Add ability to delete reason template from reason templates screen?
Add ability to delete action template from action templates screen?

Setting for password / biometric lock

Preset reason and action templates?

Data view:
See event total for different time periods
A calendar view showing the last <time period> of events
Events derive a severity from urge severity and action severity (if present)
Calendar can have colors for each time period
Event severities should all be associated with a color spectrum
A time period can show either a base color or the color of the event in it
If a time period has multiple events in it, need to handle averaging the colors together

Analysis:
List of types of data views, e.g., 'Most events are on this day of the week', 'Most events are during this time of day'

Sharing / export options

Maybe note the location an event happened

Have some information for users
Have suicide hotline and prevention type info (websites, phone numbers)
Would need different info per area
